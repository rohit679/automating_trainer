Contributing Guidelines
--------
Your contributions are always welcome! There are a number of ways you can contribute. These guidelines instruct how to submit issues and contribute code or documentation to [Qxf2 Automation Framework](https://github.com/qxf2/qxf2-page-object-model).

Reporting bugs
--------
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Qxf2. Before submitting a new issue, it is always a good idea to check if the same bug or enhancement is already reported. If it is, please add your comments to the existing issue instead of creating a new one.

* __Use a clear and descriptive title__ for the issue to identify the problem
* __Explain the steps to reproduce__ so that others can understand it and and preferably also reproduce it
* __Provide snippets to demonstrate the steps__ which you might think is causing the bug
* Expected result
* Actual results
* Environment details: Operating system and its version, packages installed


Enhancement requests
--------
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/qxf2/qxf2-page-object-model/issues). Enhancements can be anything including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* __Use a clear and descriptive title__ for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* __Provide a step-by-step description__ of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
* __Provide specific examples__ to demonstrate the steps.
* __Describe the current behavior__ and __describe which behavior you expected to see instead__ and why.
